Complex models in modern science and are now routinely expressed as software. The PLAS4Sci lab (Programming Languages and Systems
for Science) at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/), [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/) is a sub-group
of the [PLAS group](https://research.kent.ac.uk/programming-languages-systems/) focussed on improving the state-of-the-art in programming languages, programming systems, and programming tools to support the daily work of scientists.
