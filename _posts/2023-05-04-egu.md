Dominic attended the [European Geosciences Union, EGU23](https://egu23.eu/) in Vienna, which provided a great
opportunity to catch-up with many of our scientific collaborators, especially in the [DataWave](https://datawaveproject.github.io/)
and [SASIP](https://sasip-climate.github.io/) teams. There were a number of presentations of our work during the week:

* [Gilberto Pastorello](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/uds/staff/gilberto-pastorello/) from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory presented our collaboration on the [ONEFlux](https://github.com/fluxnet/ONEFlux) data processing
tool for land-atmopshere cabord flux, with a poster presentation ([corresponding abstract](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-11187.html?pdf)).

* At the DataWave side meeting, Jack Atkinson from [ICCS](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/) presented [our work](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/climate-informatics-2023/assets/pdfs/Reducing_the_overhead_of_coupled_ML_models.pdf)
on improving interoperation between Fortran and pythonic machine learning libaries, applied to the Gravity Wave Drag parameterizations in atmospheric models. 

* At the DataWave side meeting, I presented a short talk about [Analysis and lightweight verification of Fortran code](https://dorchard.github.io/slides/egu-datawave-camfort.pdf) using
the CamFort tool and demonstrated some of its lightweight static analysis tooling by running it live on the MiMA moist atmospheric
model.
