It has been an autumn (and November) where I (Dominic) have given quite a few talks about my work in this area.

* In September, "[From C to Comonads to Climate - A Functional Programmer's Journey in Array Programming](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5yguvyIL_ZERBzEioW92OXKdttFuyWA/view?usp=sharing)"  as the keynote at the [1st ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Programming for Productivity and Performance (FProPerâ€™24)](https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/fproper-2024), co-located with ICFP 2024 in Milan, Italy.
* In November, "[Computing for Climate Science and Programming for the Planet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12CRPiaChoKZ6sfPZoYGvlYnlyQB06P1g/view)" at the departmental seminar of the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Cambridge, where I spend half my time, and in short form at Queens' college at the Monday night SCR talks.
* Also in November, "Writing Computational Models that are FAIR and VRAI" (slides on request) at the Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge.
* And again in November (busy month!), "[Taming the Black Box - Effectively Leveraging ML Sub-Models (some thoughts and case studies)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uUs4fhGCazKsuG20NFHE8qM2t8_QozBe)" at the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science (CCfCS) Winter Symposium 2024, University of Cambridge.

Some of the content of these talks is currently in draft stages of a paper I hope to submit in the early new year.
