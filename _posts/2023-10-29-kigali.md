Dominic attended the [World Climate Research Programme - Open Science Conference 2023](https://wcrp-osc2023.org/) in Kigali, Rwanda in October.

Alongside this, he helped deliver a one-day training workshop on software engineering good practice and programming in the context
of climate science. Particularly, Dominic gave a session on using [Using types to rule out bugs - Python vs Fortran perspective](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuXnrbbND_cHmE5xpgIJ6u--CUaCiX2J/view).

At the conference, Dominic gave a talk on [Research Software Engineering for the New Generation of Climate Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uUs4fhGCazKsuG20NFHE8qM2t8_QozBe) giving an overview of the work of the Institute of Computing for Climate Science and a spotlight on some of
the interesting challenges going forwards.
