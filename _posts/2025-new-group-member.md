We are excited to have Chinmayi Baramashetru joining the group at Kent as a postdoctoral research associate 
to work on targetting programming language theory techniques to climate modelling problems. Chinmayi has a background
in formal methods and verification, having recently finished her doctoral studies at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway.
