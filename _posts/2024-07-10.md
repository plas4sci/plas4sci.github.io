title: "Hiring: 33-month postdoc position opportunity on Programming Languages and Systems for Climate Science"
category: job
---
I'm hiring a postdoc to work with me at the University of Kent on programming languages, tools, and systems for 
climate science in partnership with the [Institute of Computing For Climate Science](https://iccs.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambrige.

Details can be found [here](https://jobs.kent.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?ref=CEMS-264-24). __Closing date 9th September 2024__

Here's a video about the position and potential ideas that a succesful candidate could explore:

Potential topics include:

* Static analysis tooling for numerical models
* Verification of critical libraries used by scientists
* Novel language ideas for future computational models
* Extending existing languages with novel features to support science
* Developing new tools to support climate scientists

 Other ideas possible that I'd love to hear. I'm looking for someone who is excited about applying PL ideas into the climate modelling domain. There will be a chance to work alongside scientists to try out ideas 'in the field' through my network.
