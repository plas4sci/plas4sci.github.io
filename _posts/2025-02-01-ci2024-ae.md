I am cross-posting a blog post that [I wrote on the ICCS blog](https://iccs.cam.ac.uk/news/artifact-evaluation-years-climate-informatics-2024) about the Artifcat Evaluation process we put in place at Climate Informatics 2024 this year.

  In 2024, the Climate Informatics conference embarked, for the first time, on adding an Artifact Evaluation (AE) process following the standard peer review process. This provided an opportunity to embed the values of reproducibility into the publication process in a lightweight opt-in fashion, thus encouraging authors to make software available and the results of the paper reproducible.  The submitted artifacts were evaluated by a team of reviewers who provided feedback to the authors to help develop their artifacts towards a higher standard of computational reproducibility.

This blog post reports on the background motivation for this endeavour and some details of the process this year.
